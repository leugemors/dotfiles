# Dotfiles

A repo to store my personal configuration files. I can't promise they will
be useful to anyone, but feel free to take a look, use them, copy them, or
do whatever you like with them.

I might move to `stow` pretty soon, so I can manage my dotfiles more easily.
So expect some more changes in the future.

## My aliasses, vim and shell configuration

- .aliases
- .bashrc (I don't use bash anymore)
- .gitconfig
- .tmux.conf
- .vimrc
- .vimrc.simple (A minimal vimrc)
- .zshrc

## Various configuration files

I'm using Alacritty as my preferred shell. Kitty and Terminator are only there for testing purposes (I like to play around :_-) ). And as you can see, I do like the Dracule themes quite a lot.

- .config/alacritty/ (Including a bunch of themes)
- .config/htop/
- .config/kitty/
- .config/newsboat/
- .config/picom/
- .config/qtile/
- .config/redshift/
- .config/terminator/
- .config/waypaper/
- .config/zed/
- .config/starship.toml
